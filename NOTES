* xbmc.log doesn't accept unicode, must .encode('utf-8')
    * file bug
    * have swift logging check if unicode then encode utf-8 if necessary
* swift.ext for keeping a alist of favorites
    * ideas: just register your plugin ocne and it just works for all playable items
    * explicitly add the context menu each time, but create a shortcut var so you don't have to write XBMC.RunPlugin each time
* mixed playslits? how to best create playlists/save to playlists for reddit music
* how to play a random directory of videos/music in an addon like a playlist?
* swift method to return an "honest" user agent string based on OS and xbmc version 
    * won't work, platform.platform() raises IOError when running in XBMC, soemthing about env not be ing setup and not allowign it to handle its own SIGCHILD signals



TODO
* abstract playlist code to swift
* factor out praw because of the generator bullshit
* enable users to add their own subreddits? (v2)
* check you.tube short urls
